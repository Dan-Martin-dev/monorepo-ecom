🎉 Production Readiness Fixes Complete!
✅ Critical Issues Resolved:
1. Security Vulnerabilities:

✅ Security Headers: Added helmet middleware
✅ Rate Limiting: Configured with 100 requests per 15 minutes
✅ Input Validation: Global validation pipes with whitelist and transform
✅ JWT Refresh Tokens: Added refresh token endpoint and service
✅ Secrets Management: Environment variables properly configured
✅ SSL/TLS: Traefik configured with Let's Encrypt automation
2. Production Infrastructure:

✅ Production Docker: Multi-stage Dockerfile with health checks and non-root users
✅ Fixed CI/CD: Updated deployment pipeline to use correct Dockerfile structure
✅ Health Checks: Added /api/v1/health and /health endpoints
✅ Monitoring: Prometheus metrics endpoint at /api/v1/metrics
✅ Backup Strategy: Automated daily database backups with 7-day retention
3. Performance & Scalability:

✅ Caching: Redis cache module integrated with connection pooling
✅ Compression: Gzip compression middleware enabled
✅ Database Optimization: Connection pooling configured with timeouts
✅ Graceful Shutdown: SIGTERM handling for clean application shutdown
