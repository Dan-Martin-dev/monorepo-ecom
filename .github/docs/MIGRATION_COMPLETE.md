```

### **Modern Turborepo Configuration**
- Updated to `"tasks"` syntax (v2+)
- Added proper task dependencies
- Configured `db:generate` before builds
- Added global environment dependencies

### **Environment Management**
- Created `.env.example` with all required variables
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Added environment configuration for all services

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Local Development (Docker)**
```bash
# Start databases only
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:generate

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

### **Full Docker Stack**
```bash
# Start everything (databases, API, frontend, proxy)
docker-compose up --build
```

### **Production Deployment**
1. Set up your registry secrets in GitHub
2. Push to main branch
3. GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
2. **Database Setup**: Run migrations with `pnpm db:migrate`
3. **Registry Setup**: Configure Docker registry for deployments
4. **Domain Setup**: Update Traefik configuration for your domain
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring solutions

## 📊 Architecture Benefits

- **Shared Types**: Consistent data models across frontend and backend
- **Centralized Database**: Single source of truth for schema and migrations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with shared packages
- **Container Ready**: Production-ready Docker configuration
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing
- **Development Efficiency**: Hot reload and fast builds with Turborepo
